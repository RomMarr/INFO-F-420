        <h6> Definition: </h6>
        <p>Given two points p,q in a polygon P of n vertices, the geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path between p and q within the polygon. 
            Unlike the Euclidean distance, the geodesic distance doesn't have to be straight. It can be broken lines <a href="Bibliography.html#GeodesicHull">[5]</a>.</p>
            
        <p>If a polygon is convex, then the geodesic distance is equal to the euclidean distance because there are no obstacle to avoid <a href="Bibliography.html#ComparativeSurvey">[6]</a>.</p>



        <p><i>There are two important concepts in geodesic distances:</i> </p>
        <ol>
        <li> <strong> Geodesic Center</strong> : the Geodesic Center is a point in the polygon that minimizes the maximum geodesic distance to any other point.</li>
      <li><strong> Geodesic Diameter</strong>: It is the maximum geodesic distance between any two points in the polygon<a href="Bibliography.html#ER-Completeness">[3]</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="Properties"> 
        <h6>Properties: </h6>
        <ol>
            <li> Given two points p,q in a polygon P, if P is a simple polygon, then it exists a geodesic path between them and it is unique.</li>
          <li>Given two points p,q in a polygon P, the geodesic path between p and q is always a polygonal chain whose vertices (other than the endpoints) are reflex vertices of P.</li>
            <li>Given two points p,q in a polygon P, if the geodesic path between p and q is a straight line segment, we say that the points can "see" each other<a href="Bibliography.html#Visibility">[7]</a>. </li>

      <section id="The funnel algorithm"> 
        <h6>The funnel algorithm: </h6>
        <p>The Funnel Algorithm is an linear algorithm that finds the shortest path between p and q in a polygon by computing the funnel between them. </p>

    <p><i>Here are the step of the algorithm :</i> </p>
        <ol>
        <li> Triangulate the polygon. It can be done in linear time.</li>
      <li> Find the &tau;(p) et &tau;(q)(the triangle in which p and q are contained).</li>
      <li> ind the &tau;(&pi;(p,q)), the path of triangles between p and q and find the set of diagonals that is crossed by the path between p and q. The diagonals must be sorted (the i-th diagonal is the i-th diagonal we encounter on the path).
      </li>
      <li> Initialize the funnel the first F_1 = &alpha;_1, p, &beta;_1  where &alpha;_1 and &beta;_1 are the vertices of the first diagonal intersected by the path. This funnel represents the shortest path from p to the first diagonal.</li>
      <li> For each subsequent triangle i along the path, form F_i by adjusting the vertices to keep the shortest path from p to the current diagonal and adjust the apex if the funnel crosses itself. </li>
      <li> Iterate until we reach q <a href="Bibliography.html#Visibility">[4]</a> .</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It also exists approximation algorithms but we won't discuss them. </p>

      <section id="L1 Geodesic Distance"></section>
      <h6>L1 Geodesic Distance: </h6>
      <p>The L1 Geodesic Distance between two points in a polygon P is the shortest path distance between these points when measured using the L1 distance metric (also known as Manhattan distance). 
      In this metric, the distance is measured using only horizontal and vertical movements which offers certain advantages such as : </p>
      <ol>
        <li> The computation time of the L1 geodesic diameter, radius and center can be linear.</li>
      <li> The farthest-neighbor Voronoi diagram under L1 geodesic distance can be constructed efficiently.</li>
      <li> There are at most four extreme points of any compact subset S in the polygon that respects the L1 geodesic distance unlike in the Euclidean metric where we can have a lot more. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this project, we will describe an algorithm to find the L1 Geodesic Distance in polyominoes but it can easily be adapted to a simple polygon by decomposing the polygon into cells and applying the algorithm on the decomposition.</p>


      <section id= "L1 Geodesic Distance algorithm">
        <h7>L1 Geodesic Distance Algorithm</h7>
        <p>It is simple to find the L_1 geodesic distance between two points in a polyominoes. The algorithm is based on the concept of breadth-first-search.</p>
        <p>First, we identify the cells in the polyomino where the two points are. Then, we perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the cell of the initial point. 
          The first encounter with the target cell provides the shortest geodesic distance. During the BFS, 
          we maintain a queue of cells to explore, marking each visited cell to avoid revisiting the same cells multiple times. The geodesic  L_1-distance is then calculated 
          as the sum of the horizontal and vertical steps along the shortest path found by the BFS.  </p>

        <p>This method ensures an efficient computation of  L_1-geodesic distances in polyominoes, as described in <a href="Bibliography.html#ER-Completeness">[3]</a>.</p>

      <p>To test the algorithm, create a polyomino without hole <a href="DAGPpolimonies.html#def"></a>  and put two points:
