        <h2> Art Gallery Problem</h2>
        <p> As mentioned previously, <strong> Art Gallery Problem </strong> is a problem where we must find the minimum number of guards that need to be placed in an n-vertex simple polygon such that all points
        of the interior are visible. Two points are visible to each other if the line between them is always inside the polygon. </p>

        <p>This problem is NP-Hard, meaning that it is difficult to find a solution but easy to verify one. It is challenging to find a solution because we need to consider all possible combinations 
        of guard placements to ensure that every point in the polygon is visible. As the number of vertices increases, the number of possible configurations grows exponentially.
        However, verifying a solution is relatively easy, as it only involves checking that every point is visible to at least one guard.</p>

    <p>In 1973, Václav Chvátal demonstrated in a complicated proof that to guard a simple polygon with n vertices, &lfloor; n / 3 &rfloor; guards are always sufficient and sometimes necessary. 
    Later, Steve Fisk offered a simpler proof by using the triangulation of a polygon. Every simple polygon can be triangulated. Then, we can use the vertices from the triangulation to 3-color the graph. Every triangle must have all three colors. </p>
    <p>The color used the fewest vertices defines a valid set of guards with at most &lfloor; n / 3 &rfloor; because the n vertices of the polygon are partitioned with 3 colors.</p>
    <p>Bellow, we have implemented the algorithm that find a set of guards such that all the points are visible using the proof above. Draw a polygon and it will show where and how many guards you need to guard the gallery<a href="Bibliography.html#AGP">[8]</a>.</p>
