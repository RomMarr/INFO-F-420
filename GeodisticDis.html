        <h6> Definition: </h6>
        <p>Given two points p,q in a polygon P of n vertices, the geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path between p and q within the polygon. 
            Unlike the Euclidean distance, the geodesic distance doesn't have to be straight. It can be broken lines.</p>
            
        <p>If a polygon is convex, then the geodesic distance is equal to the euclidean distance because there are no obstacle to avoid.</p>



        <p><i>There are two important concepts in geodesic distances:</i> </p>
        <ol>
        <li> <strong> Geodesic Center</strong> : the Geodesic Center is a point in the polygon that minimizes the maximum geodesic distance to any other point.</li>
      <li><strong> Geodesic Diameter</strong>: It is the maximum geodesic distance between any two points in the polygon.</li>
      </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="Properties"> 
        <h6>Properties: </h6>
        <ol>
            <li> Given two points p,q in a polygon P, if P is a simple polygon, then it exists a geodesic path between them and it is unique.</li>
          <li>Given two points p,q in a polygon P, the geodesic path between p and q is always a polygonal chain whose vertices (other than the endpoints) are reflex vertices of P.</li>
            <li>Given two points p,q in a polygon P, if the geodesic path between p and q is a straight line segment, we say that the points can "see" each other. </li>
          </ol>

      <section id="The funnel algorithm"> 
        <h6>The funnel algorithm: </h6>
        <p>The Funnel Algorithm is an linear algorithm that finds the shortest path between p and q in a polygon by computing the funnel between them. </p>

    <p><i>Here are the step of the algorithm :</i> </p>
        <ol>
        <li> Triangulate the polygon. It can be done in linear tine.</li>
      <li> Find the &tau;(p) et &tau;(q)(the triangle in which p and q are contained).</li>
      <li> Find the &tau;(&pi;(p,q)) (the set of diagonals that is crossed by the path between p and q) and sort them. (the i-th diagonal is the i-th diagonal we encounter on the path.)</li>
      <li> Initialize the funnel the first F_1 = \(&alpha;_1, p, &beta;_1\)  where &alpha;_1 and &beta;_1 are the vertices of the first diagonal intersected by the path. This funnel represents the shortest path from p to the first diagonal.</li>
      <li> For each subsequent triangle i along the path, form F_i by adjusting the vertices to keep the shortest path from p to the current diagonal. </li>
      <li> Iterate until we reach q.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It also exists approximation algorithms but we won't discuss them. </p>
