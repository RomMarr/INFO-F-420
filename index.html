        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The art gallery problem is a well known problem in computational geometry. The problem is described as follows : An art gallery wants to hire guardians to keep the gallery safe.
             They want to hire the smallest number of guards possible but be sure that together they can observe the whole gallery. There must be no blind spot.
            In a more formal way we can express it in this way : given a polygon <strong>P</strong> and an integer <em>n</em>, give a set of k guards that sees every point of the polygon if it exists. </p>
            
        <p> will address the original problem but our main focus will be on a modified version of it : <strong>The Dispersive Art Gallery Problem</strong> <a href="WebPage/Bibliography.html#Rieck">[1]</a>. In this problem we donâ€™t try to minimize the amount of guards but we want to maximize the distance between each guard. Maximizing the distance can be more 
            efficient for the security of the gallery. In a more formal way, we obtain : given a polygon P and a distance l, give a set of any numbers of guards 
            such that the distance between each guard is at least l and they see every point of the polygon if it exists. We will also consider that guards are restricted 
            to being placed only at the vertices of the polygon. This means that while the entire interior must be visible, guards cannot be positioned arbitrarily within the polygon or along its edges. 
            This limitation focuses the problem on vertex-based visibility.</p>
